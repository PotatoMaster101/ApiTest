# API Authentication
Play around with ASP.NET core API's authentication feature.

## Warning
- The token signing key has been hardcoded in `appsettings.json` for demo purpose; for real app you would wanna store it outside of the repo, such as `secrets.json`
- The user credentials are hardcoded to `test:test` for demo purpose; for real app you would wanna use third party provider such as Auth0 or Azure B2C
